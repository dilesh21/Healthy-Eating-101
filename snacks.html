                  <h4>Indian Chicken Keema Sliders - Preparation method</h4>
                  <ol type="1">
                  <li>Firstly roast all the masalas including cumin seeds, cinnamon stick, cloves, black pepper corns, coriander seeds, star anise and Kashmiri dry red chillies at low heat in a flat pan till fragrant. Set it aside.</li>

<li>Once cool, powder them or pound in a pestle and mortar. Heat the oil in a pan on medium-high flame.</li>

<li>Once the oil is hot and simmering, add the onion, ginger, garlic and green chillies.</li>

<li>Keep and eye on it and keep sautéing for about 15-20 minutes till the onions moisture and start to turn brown.</li>

<li>Reduce the flame to low, add the ground spices. Saute for 20 seconds and add in the onions. Add the chopped tomatoes with their water and keep cooking till the tomatoes soften and turn mushy.</li>

<li>If the mixture is burning, add a splash of water. This should take another 10 minutes. Add yogurt in 3 batches. Mixing well every time you add the yogurt.</li>

<li>Cook for about 2 minutes. Next add in the chicken keema and with your ladle break any clumps and mix well.</li>

<li>Do this step quickly before the chicken starts to cook to avoid lumps. Add water if required, cook the chicken in the spices for about 10-15 minutes till the curry starts to simmer.</li>

<li>Once it simmers (bubbles on the surface) cook for another 5 minutes to ensure its done. Finish with juice of one whole Lemon and Coriander Leaves.</li>

<li>Toast the slider buns with little bit of butter. Scoop the chicken keema inside and serve.</li>

                  <h4>Prawn Masala Kozhukattai - Preparation method</h4>
                  <ol type="1">
                    <li>To begin making the Prawn Masala Kozhukattai Recipe - Prawn Masala Dumplings, prep all the ingredients and keep them ready.</li>
<li>Heat oil in a heavy bottomed pan over medium heat. Add the mustard seeds, dry red chillies (broken), curry leaves and allow it to crackle. Add the ginger, garlic and onions - saute for a few minutes until the onions soften. </li>
<li>Add the tomatoes, red chilli powder, turmeric powder, curry leaves, salt and saute until the tomatoes become mushy and soft. Add the chopped prawns, coconut and little water. Cover the pan and cook till the prawns are cooked and the masala dries up. </li>
<li>Once done, check the salt and spices in the prawns masala and turn off the heat. </li>
<li>Once done, garnish with coriander leaves and the prawn masala filling is ready. </li>
<li>In a saucepan, add the rice flour, water and salt. Stir well to combine. </li>
<li>Turn on heat to medium. Stir continuously until the rice batter becomes thick and leaves the sides of the pan. The process takes between 15 to 20 minutes for the batter to getting into a dough like mixture. </li>
<li>It is very important not to let go of the mixture even for a second without stirring, as it will form lumps. To make a smooth wrapper we need to have a dough without any lumps. </li>
<li>Test for doneness: Hold the latter with the cooked batter and it should not fall off. This means the dough for the wrapper is ready. </li>
<li>Turn of heat and transfer the rice dough into another container. Cover with a wet muslin cloth and keep warm. </li>
<li>With a little oil in a cup, smear the oil in your hands and knead the rice flour dough well to remove any lumps. At all times make sure keep the dough covered with a wet muslin cloth to prevent the dough from drying out. </li>
<li>Take a lemon size portion of the dough, make into a ball and press the dough in the palm of your hands to make a flat dough, cup your palms a bit so it forms a depression in the center. </li>
<li>Place the prawn masala filling in the center and bring the edges of the dough together to the center. Continue the similar process with the remaining portions of the dough and prawn masala filling. </li>
<li>Note: Don't make the dough too thin, the filling could come out when you try to wrap it. </li>
<li>Note: Keep dipping and smearing your fingers and palms with sesame oil when you handle a new portion of the dough. This will prevent the dough from sticking to your hands</li>
<li>Prepare the steamer filled with water. Place the filled Prawn Masala Kozhukattai in the steamer plate and into the steamer. Steam for about 10 minutes until the Prawn Masala Kozhukattai / Dumplins look shiny and smooth. </li>
<li>You will also notice that if it is not cooked, the rice wrapper will be sticky. </li>
<li>Once they are steamed, the Prawn Masala Kozhukattai are to be served. </li>

                        <li>If you’re making your own dough, tip the flour and 1 tsp salt into a bowl. Bring a kettle to the boil and measure 150ml boiling water. Slowly pour the water over the flour while mixing with a spoon to form a stiff dough. When the dough is cool enough to handle, tip onto a surface and knead for 10 mins until smooth. Wrap the dough and chill for at least 1 hr. Alternatively, you can use 25-30 shop-bought gyoza skins.</li>

                        <li>Meanwhile, coarsely grate the cabbage, mushrooms, carrot and water chestnuts, if using, then tip into a bowl. Add the ginger, garlic and spring onions. Heat the oil in a wok, then tip in all the veg and stir-fry over a high heat for 3 mins until softened. Drizzle over the soy sauce and sake, and cook for 2-3 mins. Season to taste. Tip back into the bowl to cool completely. </li>
                        
                        
                        <li>Divide the dough in two. Scatter a surface generously with cornflour and roll one ball of dough out until paper-thin. Use a 10cm cutter to cut out rounds of dough and pile them up (they won’t stick because of the cornflour). Repeat with all the dough, re-rolling the trimmings until you have about 25 skins. </li>
                        
                        
                        <li>To assemble, sprinkle cornflour on a tray and have a bowl of cold water ready. Hold a skin in the palm of one hand and put a teaspoon of the filling in the centre. Dip your finger in the water and wipe around the inside edge of the skin. Bring the edges of the skin together, pinching pleats along one side. Space them out on a baking tray and freeze, then tip into a bag and put back in the freezer. Will keep for three months. Can be cooked from frozen. </li>
                        
                        
                        <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in a non-stick frying pan with a lid. Fry, flat-side down, for 2 mins until golden. Add 100ml water to the pan and cover. Cook over a medium heat for 3-5 mins until the water has evaporated and the gyoza is cooked through. Remove the lid and leave the gyoza to sizzle on the bottom for a minute. Mix the dipping sauce ingredients together, then serve with the gyoza. </li>

                          <li>Heat 175ml water in a saucepan until steaming, then add the butter. Remove from the heat and leave to cool until the mixture is just warm (it should not be hot). Combine the flour, yeast, sugar and 1 tsp salt in a large bowl or stand mixer. </li>

<li>Add the cooled butter mixture, and mix to a soft dough using a wooden spoon or the mixer. Knead for 10 mins by hand (or 5 mins using a mixer) until the dough feels bouncy and smooth. Transfer to an oiled bowl and cover with a clean tea towel. Leave somewhere warm to rise for 1½-2 hrs, or until doubled in size. Alternatively, leave to prove in the fridge overnight. </li>

<li>Oil and line a baking sheet with baking parchment. Knock the air out of the dough, then knead again for several minutes. Flatten a small piece of dough (about 20g) into a disc, and put a cube of the mozzarella and a pinch of the gruyère into the middle of the disc. </li>

<li>Enclose the cheeses with the dough, then roll into a ball. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining cheese and dough, placing the dough balls ½cm apart on the baking sheet – they should be just touching after proving. Cover with a clean tea towel and leave somewhere warm to rise for 30 mins. </li>

<li>Meanwhile, make the garlic butter. Melt the butter in a small pan over a low heat, then stir in the garlic and rosemary. Remove from the heat and set aside until needed. </li>

<li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Brush the risen dough balls with the garlic butter, then bake for 25-30 mins until the dough balls are cooked through and the middles are oozing. </li>

<li>While the dough balls are baking, make the tomato sauce dip. Heat the oil in a saucepan and fry the garlic for 30 seconds. Tip in the passata, vinegar, sugar and chilli flakes, and simmer for 10 mins until thickened. </li>

<li>Season to taste and stir in the basil. Brush the warm dough balls with any remaining garlic butter, then serve with the tomato sauce dip on the side for dunking. </li>

                        <li>Put all the ingredients, except the oil, in a bowl with ½ tsp salt, and squidge it all together using your hands. The moisture from the courgettes should help bind everything together; you want a sticky but not overly wet mixture.</li>

<li>Fill a heavy-based saucepan no more than a third full with oil and set over a medium heat until the oil reaches 180C. If you don’t have a cooking thermometer, test it’s ready by dropping in a pinch of the pakora mixture. It should sizzle and turn golden brown after 10-20 seconds. </li>

<li>Carefully drop tablespoons of the mixture into the oil, using another tablespoon to help you slide them in. </li>

<li>Fry for about 2 mins before turning and cooking for a further 2-3 mins until golden brown, crisp and cooked through. Continue frying in batches until all the mixture has been used up. </li>

<li>Leave to drain on kitchen paper. You can keep the cooked pakoras warm in a low oven while you make the rest. Serve immediately with your favourite chutney, if you like. </li>
