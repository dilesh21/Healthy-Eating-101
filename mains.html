                  <h4>Slow Cooked Shredded Beef Ragu Pasta - Preparation method</h4>
                  <ol type="1">
                    <li>Pat beef dry and sprinkle with salt and pepper</li>

                    <li>Sear Beef: Heat 1 tbsp olive oil over high heat in a heavy based pot. Add beef and sear each piece aggressively on all sides until very browned (3 - 5 minutes in total), then remove onto a plate. </li>
                    
                    <li>Turn stove down to medium low and add remaining 2 tbsp of olive oil. </li>
                    
                    <li>Soffrito: Add garlic and onion and sauté for 2 minutes. Then add the carrots and celery and sauté slowly for 5 minutes. </li>
                    
                    <li>Add remaining Ragu ingredients and return the beef to the pot (including pooled juices). Turn the stove up and bring it to a simmer, then turn it down to low so it's bubbling very very gently. </li>
                    
                    <li>Slow cook: Cover the pot and let it cook for 2 hours or until beef is tender enough to shred.</li>
                    
                    <li>Shred: Remove beef then coarsely shred with 2 forks. Return beef to the pot. Simmer for 30 minutes until sauce is reduced and thickened - beef will soften slightly more during this step. </li>
                    
                    <li>Final season: Do a taste test and adjust the seasoning to your taste with salt and pepper. ALSO, add 1/2 tsp sugar if sauce is a bit sour for your taste. Place the lid on and set aside until ready to serve</li>
                    <li>To Serve
                    <ol type="I" style="margin-left: 1em;">
                    <li>Bring a very large pot of water with 1 tbsp of salt to the boil. </li>
                    
                    <li>Add pasta and cook for 1 minute less than the recommended cooking time as per the packet instructions. </li>
                    
                    <li>Meanwhile, place 5 cups of the Ragu in a very large fry pan, dutch oven or use 2 normal size fry pans. Heat over high heat while the pasta is cooking. </li>
                    
                    <li>When the pasta is ready, transfer it directly from the pot into the fry pan using tongs. </li>
                    
                    <li>Add 3/4 cup of pasta water into the fry pan. </li>
                    
                    <li>Gently toss the pasta for 1 to 2 minutes, until the sauce water evaporates and leaves you with a thick Ragu sauce that coats the pasta. </li>
                    
                    <li>Serve with plenty of freshly grated parmesan, or even better, with parmigiano reggiano. </li>
                                      
                                      </ol>

                        <li>Cook the spaghetti according to the instructions on the package.</li>
<li>Rinse and drain the kidney beans. Put them in a medium bowl and mash them well with a fork or a potato masher. </li>
<li>In a medium pan, heat some oil and sauté the onions for 3 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute. </li>
<li>Put the sunflower seeds in a food processor and pulse until a fine meal is achieved. </li>
<li>Add the sauteed onion and garlic to the mashed beans together with the spices, the tomato paste, the soy sauce, the ground sunflower seeds, and the oats. Season with salt and pepper. </li>
<li>Use your hands to thoroughly mix everything. Then form about 12-14 vegan meatballs. (Please note that I doubled the recipe for the photos, so there are more meatballs). </li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350 °F bake the vegan meatballs for about 15 minutes. Carefully flip them halfway through the baking time. </li>
<li>Alternatively you could also pan-fry them. In a medium pan, heat some olive oil over medium heat and gently roast the bean balls for about 4 minutes until they are golden. You'll achieve the best results with a cast iron pan.  However, it is recommended to use the baking method. Not only is this version oil-free, they meatballs also become more crispier and firmer this way. </li>
<li>Make the marinara sauce: In a medium pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Sauté the onions for 3 minutes, then add the garlic and the carrot. Cook for another 2-3 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes. </li>
<li>Then deglaze with red wine and allow to evaporate. Add diced tomatoes and simmer for about 10 minutes. Season with oregano, salt, and pepper. Before serving add some fresh basil leaves. </li>
<li>Make the cashew Parmesan: Put the cashews, nutritional yeast, salt, and garlic powder in a food processor and pulse until a fine meal is achieved. </li>
<li>Serve the spaghetti with the marinara and vegan meatballs and sprinkle with Parmesan and fresh basil leaves. </li>

                        <ol type="1">
                          <li>Tie the thyme, parsley, and bay leaf into a bouquet with kitchen twine. </li>
<li>Put 2 tablespoon (30 ml) broth in a large skillet, Dutch oven or stock pot see note) and heat on medium heat. </li>
<li>When the broth begins to boil add the mushrooms, onion and carrots and cook for five minutes. </li>
<li>Stir frequently and add a few more tablespoon of broth if needed. </li>
<li>Add the garlic and stir well. Cook for two minutes. </li>
<li>If you are cooking this in your slow cooker, transfer the onions, carrots, mushrooms and garlic from the pan to the cooker (if cooking in a stock pot or Dutch oven, leave the onions and add the potatoes and remaining ingredients) and add the potatoes, the remaining broth, 2 cups (480 ml) water, tamari or soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, herbs, and salt and pepper. </li>
<li>Gently push the herbs into the broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to simmer and cook for one hour, or two or more hours in your slow cooker. </li>
<li>The longer you cook the stew the softer the potatoes will become. </li>
<li>For the Roux
<ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman; margin-left: 1em;">
<li>Melt the butter in a small saucepan on medium heat. </li>
<li>When it's melted whisk in the flour until it's creamy and thick. Whisk in the milk until it's creamy and slurry. </li>
<li>Stir it into the stew until it's completely combined and let it simmer for approximately ten minutes until the broth thickens. </li>
<li>Remove the herbs. </li>
<li>Taste and add more salt and pepper as needed. </li>
