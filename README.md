Features Left to Implement

A floating “Back to top button” that would help get back to the navigation bar without constantly scrolling. Currently the quickest way to get back to the top is by getting to the footer where there is a “Back to top button”.

Another option for the above-mentioned feature would be to have a navigation bar/header that always stays at the top of the page while scrolling or a static side bar that collapse when on mobile.

Allow users to rate and comment/review on different recipes would help to encourage other users to try said recipes
